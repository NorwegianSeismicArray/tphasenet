# TPhaseNet: Phase picking for regional seismic data

Code related to the submitted paper **Deep learning models for regional phase detection on seismic stations in Northern Europe and the European Arctic**.

Tested setup for installation of required packages  :

```
conda create -n test python=3.10.12
conda activate test
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To train a model for phase detection run :

```
python train.py
```

All training and model parameters can be changed in config.yaml.

This is a simply training example on a cpu. It is recommend to train on gpu.
To train on gpu you have to adapt the call of train.py for example using docker.

Due to limited space on GitHub, this example uses a dummy training data set with only a few events (tf/data).
Currently, to train you own model, you must generate your own data. The data structure can be explored by loading
the dummy training data files. We plan to make a larger dataset available.

The models used in the paper are also too large for GitHub and will be provided here soon:

[Zenodo repository](https://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11231543)

To pick arrivals in continuous data of station ARA0 first download the models, store tjem in tf/output/models,
adjust pred_config.yaml, and then run:

```
python predict.py
```
